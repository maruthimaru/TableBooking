Quantum-Cinemas-Movie Booking App(Android-Applicaion)
People usually tend to go out with friends, families or loved ones to watch movies. They demand a genuine and fantastic application to view the movie collection and booking tickets without standing in long queue inside the theatre. This application is a great community for rating movies, getting ShowTime and Date, watching trailers, getting the movie reviews.
It is just the most consistent app, in our experience, and it makes it easy to book tickets and get latest movie details and trailers. The app also lets you rate movies, see new releases etc. The app features grow by having search and filter facilities for theatres and the movie of your choice. You can also select seats inside theatre to your convenience. Booking can be very easy using multiplex GUI seat selection
